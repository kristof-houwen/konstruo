Konstruo 
============

Name comes from the Latin word 'construo' meaning construct, build, arrange, establish, rear, fabricate.  The name starts with a 'K', referring to my name Kristof.

Konstruo is a PHP MVC framework I developed as a test case, learning the MVC principles.  Use it at your own risk, be aware of the other (production ready and already proven) PHP frameworks as Laravel, Symfony, Zend ...  before using Konstruo in a real world scenario.

The framework uses Composer for management of the dependencies.
